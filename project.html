          <p>Through using cloud-based storage users were hoping to achieve more organization, use less paper, and grow their business in the next year. This survey revealed users value the storage and organization of content in their current cloud-based apps, and the ability to share content easily.</p>

        <p>After looking at all of my designs and ideas, I arrived at Draft Slam as the name of my app. It conjures fun images that communicate the collaborative nature of the application. </p>
        <p>The imagery of a slam dunk comes to mind to let the user know they will be achieving their goals with this app. The logo ideas I sketched are inspired by sports, basketball, and documents. These feel whimsical, simple, and brightly colored.</p>

        <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
        <p>Sticking with simplicity worked well for this project. Some of the biggest design flaws were restricting the user’s ability to customize their dashboard, vague content, and vague prototypes. </p>
        <p>The biggest insight I gained from this project was how to write surveys for the problem and to avoid scope creep.</p>
